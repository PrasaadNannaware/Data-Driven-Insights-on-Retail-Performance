# Superstore Sales & Forecasting Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive sales and profitability analysis for a large superstore, built using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide a 360-degree view of business performance, moving from a high-level executive summary to a detailed, predictive forecast of future trends.

The primary goal is to empower managers to identify top-performing regions, customer segments, and products, and to make data-driven decisions based on robust time-series forecasting.

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis

This dashboard is split into two strategic views:

### 1. Executive Sales Summary (Main Page)

This page serves as a high-level command center for monitoring core business health.

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
    * **Total Sales:** 8.95M
    * **Total Profit:** 1.31M
    * **Profit Margin:** 14.7%
    * **Total Quantity Ordered:** 130K
    * **Total Discount:** 467K

* **Customer & Product Analysis:**
    * **Insight:** The "Corporate" (3.27M) and "Consumer" (2.17M) segments are the most valuable, accounting for the majority of sales.
    * **Insight:** "Telephones," "Binders & Binder Accessories," and "Office Machines" are the top 3 most profitable sub-categories.
    * **Business Recommendation:** Focus marketing retention strategies on Corporate clients and ensure top-profit sub-categories are always well-stocked.

* **Temporal & Regional Analysis:**
    * **Insight:** The stacked area chart shows that "Technology" is a significant and growing component of sales, particularly in 2013.
    * **Insight:** The "Central" region is the highest-performing in terms of sales (2.54M).
    * **Business Recommendation:** Investigate the strategies used in the "Central" region and explore replicating them in lower-performing regions like the "South."

### 2. Forecasting & State-Level Analysis (Page 2)

This page provides a forward-looking analytical view to predict future performance.

* **Time-Series Forecasting (Sales & Profit):**
    * **Insight:** The dashboard utilizes Power BI's forecasting capabilities to project `Sum of Sales` and `Sum of Profit` for the upcoming year (2014-2015).
    * **Observation:** Both sales and profit show a clear upward trend, with the forecast (light green/red areas) predicting continued growth. This gives stakeholders a positive and confident outlook.
    * **Skill Demonstrated:** This moves beyond historical reporting and into predictive analytics.

* **State-Level Profitability:**
    * **Insight:** The horizontal bar chart identifies "Illinois" and "New York" as the top two most profitable states.
    * **Business Recommendation:** Management should analyze the market conditions and sales tactics in Illinois and New York to create a "playbook" for success that can be applied to less profitable states.
